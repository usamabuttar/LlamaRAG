# Building a Financial RAG Engine with LLaMA
This repository implements a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) engine named LlamaRAG, specifically designed for tasks in the financial domain. It leverages the power of the LLaMA 270B model, making it a valuable tool for open-source large language model development.

Here's a breakdown of what you'll find:

* Code demonstrating how LLaMA can be used for financial question answering tasks using RAG techniques.
* Integration with libraries like Sentence Transformer and Streamlit for efficient document embedding and a user-friendly interface.
* A Streamlit web application showcasing functionalities like summarizing financial performance, extracting entities, and analyzing sentiment.

**Important Note:** *Due to the computationally intensive nature of large language models, I strongly recommend running this project in a GPU-accelerated environment.*

This project can serve as a valuable resource for developers interested in exploring LLaMA and its applications in financial analysis and other open-source settings.


# Startup
1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/usamabuttar/LlamaRAG`
2. Go into the directory `cd LlamaRAG`
3. Startup jupyter by running `jupyter lab` in a terminal or command prompt
4. Update the `auth_token` variable in the notebook. 
5. Hit `Ctrl + Enter` to run through the notebook! 
6. If you want to start up the streamlit app run `streamlit run app.py` (make sure you update your auth token in there as well!)
